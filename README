Solution for Rosetta Code Catmullâ€“Clark subdivision surface task in Python

Thinking of using 3D version of Matplotlib plot to draw the wireframe
around each face.

Example scripts based on the input and output in the text discussion.

cccube.py - input cube graphed in 3D

outputfaces.py - desired output after one transformation
graphed in 3D.
